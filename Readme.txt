Version:

TRACKGEN v1.2

This Programm is Freeware. 

Improvements in v1.2:
- TrackGen now works correctly under Windows 8 (No more solid black window!)
- Option to use PNG textures as per OpenBVE standard.
- English translation tweaked slightly.

With the permission of Nils Busch, I've made a few small adjustments to TrackGen to make it work a little better, and 
am hosting v1.2.
Comments and questions welcome :)

Cheers

Chris Lees
